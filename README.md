<p align="justify">The idea of the program was a virtual library for a personal reading organization, where you can register your read books in a text document generated by the program - organized by title, author and the rating that the user assigned to the book - and having the option to consult them, in addition to clearing the list of books already registered. The code was written in C language, with loops and decision structures, vectors, struct, functions (calling the menu, registering a book, clearing the list of records) and pointers, as well as handling a .txt file. The action options are arranged in the initial menu, where the user can choose from 1 to 4 the desired action.</p>
